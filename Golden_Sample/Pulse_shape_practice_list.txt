GRB200829A | A pulse followed by extended emission | One or more pulses with symmetrical structure 
GRB121031A | Other | I don't see any. | The pulses do not look particularly symmetrical, and the data are incomplete.
GRB150711A | Other | Pulses connected with underlying emission | There are multiple pulses (that is, multiples ups and downs), and next pulse arises before the first pulse ends (that is, before the counts in the first pulse go back to zero).
GRB170126A | A simple pulse | One or more pulses with the fast-rise and slow-decay shape | This pulse rise quickly to the peak 
GRB220714B | A pulse followed by extended emission | Rapid varying pulses, One or more pulses with symmetrical structure | This pulse is a fast rise and peaks three times then descends rapidly
GRB220701A | Other | I don't see any of these | This is a pulse with a some noise found in this section. The noise breaks the underlying emissions when the counts is below zero
GRB220611A | Other. | I don't see any of these | This is declared as noise, looking at the entire graph shows that there is not enough difference between the pulse and noise around it as well as there is too much indifference between the pulse potential and the noise around it
GRB220501A | A pulse followed by extended emission | One or more pulses with the fast-rise and slow-decay shape | The graph has a sharp rise and takes approximately twenty seconds to disperse to the level of noise again, the remaining part of the blue area is noise since the counts dips below the 0 count mark consistently after.
GRB220408A | Other | I don't see any of these | the graph has a sharp rise and fall then rises again to a smaller pulse afterwards, so there are multiple pulses indicated here but not by underlying emission since the emission dips below the zero count mark 
GRB220403B | Other | Pulses connected with underlying emissions | The boxed region is multiple pulses, 3 main ones, that don't follow a simple concept or emit continuously but has some underlying emissions that are depicted in the graph
GRB210822A | A pulse followed by extended emissions | One or more pulses with the fast-rise and slow-decay shape | This pulse rises fast has a slower decline and has a section of the blue where the emission is above the 0 count mark indicating a pulse emission after the initial pulse
GRB210730A | A simple pulse | One or more pulses with the fast-rise and slow-decay shape | This is a fast rise and fall pulse that and has enough of a response difference to be declared a pulse where even though not fully symmetrical it can be argued; however, the bins after the peak seem to follow a slow decay trend even after the indicated blue region
GRB210726A | A simple pulse | One or more pulses with symmetrical structure | this is just a fast rise fast fall pulse with the blue region indicating only one bin, so there is not a lot to reference besides it's symmetry 
GRB210722A | Other | One or more pulses with the fast-rise and slow-decay shape | This pulse rises and peaks but slowly falls down and hits below the 0 count mark. This is the reason why the pulse is not an extended emission because after the first dip below the zero line the blue region to the right is almost identical to what looks like the noise and is not confidently displaying an emission 
GRB210708A | A simple pulse | One or more pulses with symmetrical structure | This is a pulse that can be argued as symmetrical or not since the binning of the data is minimal it is hard to determine but has a symmetrical shape of the where it peaks fast and slopes down fast again with no extra pulse indication after 
GRB210618A | A simple pulse | One or more pulses with symmetrical structure | This is a simple pulse that peaks and that is the only distinguishing characteristic that can be seen and is symmetrical in nature
GRB210610B | Other | One or more pulses with the fast-rise and slow-decay shape, pulses connected with underlying emissions | This is a multiple pulse instance that rises and peaks followed with a slow fall and peaks again before slowly decaying and emitting for an extended period of time before turning into noise again
GRB210610A | Other | Pulses connected with underlying emission | There are multiple pulses indicated in the blue region and has no easy defined shape but the binning never goes under the zero count mark so it can be determined that there are underlying emissions between the pulses
GRB210517A | A simple pulse | One or more pulses with the fast-rise and slow-decay shape | This is a pulse that rises and falls fast but has a decaying like curve after the peak with the four bins that are determined after the initial peak
GRB210419A | Other | I don't see any of these | This is too hard to tell what kind of pulse this is, but the first third of the blue region is a pulse since the binning is over the zero marker, the part after is harder to tell especially with the time scale and lack of confidence in observing this 
GRB210403A | Other | I don't see any of these | This is a pulse indication that has many regions of dipping below the zero count mark so it is hard to tell what is going on. This is a pulse data set with no noticeable descriptions using the criteria 
GRB210419C | Other | I don't see any of these | this is a pulse; however, it is hard to tell what kind of pulse this is from the graph since there is a portion above the zero count but the ends of the blue region look to be noise
GRB210430A | Other | One or more pulses with symmetrical structure, pulses connected with underlying emission| this graph shows two pulses with structurally the same rate in the rise and fall patterns with another peak connected
GRB210420B | Other | I don't see any of these | this is a pulse from the zero to twenty second region but the rest of the binning in the blue region is too difficult to tell 
GRB210402A | Other | pulses connected with underlying emission, One or more pulses with the fast-rise and slow-decay shape | There are multiple pulses depicted with fast rises and slower falls that are connected by a period of noise like data
GRB210323A | A simple pulse | One or more pulses with symmetrical structure | This is a standard pulse result it is only one bin so this is deemed symmetrical
GRB210318A | Other | I don't see any of these | The left most section of the blue region can be almost seen as a pulse with slow decay; however, with the time scale of this graph it is too difficult to tell what type of structure this is after about twenty seconds the computer generated region dips below the zero count enough where that would be considered noise. If you put down pulses connected with underlying emissions, that could be argued here and good job thinking on that, it is just too hard to tell
GRB210218A | Other | One or more pulses with the fast-rise and slow-decay shape | This is a case where the image provided has such a large time frame the data is hard to understand but there are instances of the indicated pulses dipping under the zero count mark so there is no underlying emission that can be justified between the two main pulses seen. The first one has a curve to the right that looks like a slow decay shape, that is why this was answered as follows. The rest is too compressed to gauge what is going on.
GRB210217A | A simple pulse | One or more pulses with symmetrical structure | This is a pulse that rises and falls very fast with little change in structure indicating the pulse as symmetrical. If you answered a slow decay shape instead that is also acceptable, it can be argued both ways, this shows how it depends on how people infer the data. The reason for a simple pulse is because it was a singular pulse with no extra emission after and quickly returned to noise
GRB210207B | Other | One or more pulses with symmetrical structure, pulses connected with underlying emission | there are multiple pulses depicted in this image with most of them being sharp up and down with some noise like emission between each pulse. This case is a great reference for underlying emission as seen in the left most section of the blue region where there is a sharp peak, noise like consistency above the zero count mark and then another pulse
GRB210119A | A simple pulse | One or more pulses with symmetrical structure | this is a single fast rise fast fall pulse. There is no part where the computer noticed a pulse but as a human you can notice the peak, this is a good reference to showcase that computers are never 100% perfect and a pulse like this may be missed if scientists solely relied on computers 
GRB210104B | Other | one or more pulses with symmetrical structure, Pulses connected with underlying emission| This is a case of two main pulses with an underlying emission between the two where there is binning between the two that doesn't fall below the zero count mark. The second pulse can be argued to be symmetrical or not so if that was something that was not determined, don't worry this is an instance where it is up to you to determine 
GRB201104B | Other | Pulses connected with underlying emission | this is a good example of two pulses connected by an underlying emission. Each pulse is weird in shape and doesn't follow a trend like the other options
GRB201229A | Other | I don't see any of these | this is a hard pulse to determine and there is noise like consistency between the two pulses, the first one is at the left most part of the blue region and the second is the peak in the center right area. After each pulse the data indicates it goes back below the zero count mark so there is no underlying emission and each pulse has a weird shape that is not common. 
GRB201020A | A simple pulse | One or more pulses with symmetrical structure | this is a pulse that has the about the same rise and fall rate between the peak and initial rise indicating a symmetrical figure. If you didn't determine this to be symmetrical that is also fine, it depends on how you interpret the data and can be seen as both sometimes 
GRB201024A | A simple pulse | One or more pulses with the fast-rise and slow-decay shape | this is a pulse that has a faster rise than decay that is significant enough to declare it slower decay
GRB201015A | A simple pulse | One or more pulses with symmetrical structure | The highlighted region is mainly noise, the actual pulse is the very beginning of that region and is a fast rise and fall indicating a somewhat symmetrical pulse, the binning is small enough where it is difficult to concretely tell if this is symmetrical or not but it is fast enough at a fall and rise where it can be deemed symmetric
GRB200529A | A pule followed by extended emission | One or more pulses with the fast-rise and slow-decay shape | this is a very fast rise pulse that takes a very long time to get back to noise level readings indicating a slow-decay shape and has an extended emission where the timing to get to a noise level count is a lot longer than the average burst. There is no underlying emission since at one point the data dips below the zero count
GRB200713A | Other | I don't see any of these | There is too much uncertainty in the indicated data set analyzed here it is too hard to tell what is being displayed besides the fact that the computer indicated a pulse most likely seen around 50 seconds in that above the zero count area
GRB200522A | A simple pulse | One or more pulses with symmetrical structure | this is a pulse that is fast rising and falling and only showing one pulse in this graph 
GRB200324A | Other | One or more pulses with the fast-rise and slow-decay shape | the left peak in the highlighted region is a pulse with a slow-decay shape but the two peaks that are separated by no data indicate some failure in the readings and can not be used to determine if at that time there was a second pulse. This is most likely from an issue in the data collection where a change in the trajectory of the telescope was needed to ensure there was no damage or ruined data set
GRB200306C | Other | Pulses connected with underlying emission | there are multiple pulses in this data set that are oddly shaped but connected with emissions that are all above the zero count mark indicating underlying emissions between the pulses
GRB191024A | A pulse followed by extended emission | One or more pulses with the fast-rise and slow-decay shape | this pulse indicated in the highlighted region is a fast rise takes more time to return to noise implying a slow-decay. The data deemed by the computer is not all of the pulse as the next few bins are all above the zero count mark indicating an extended emission past the computers analysis
GRB190719C | Other | One or more pulses with symmetrical structures, Pulses connected with underlying emission | The left most pulse is a rapid rise and fall with symmetrical properties followed by a main middle pulse with symmetrical properties, and at the right part of the blue region is a emission section with some peaks indicating underlying emission between pulses. 
GRB190611A | Other | I don't see any of these | The left most part of the graph is seen as a pulse but the rest is too difficult to determine and there is no pronounced shape of these potential pulses.
****************************************************
GRB200131A | A pulse followed by extended emission, Other | One or more pulses with symmetrical structure, one oe more pulses with the fast-rise and slow-decay shape | There are two pulses in the graph, the first is a symmetrical shape with a fast rise and fall and the second is the smaller peak with a fast rise and slow-decay into noise (NOTE I DONT KNOW WHY BUT I CANT CALL IT OTHER)

********** NOTES 
Pulse followed by extended emission - Much lower emission than the first pulse,
Look over each noise one and check that the values are above 0, pulses are considered in the blue region mainly above the blue region 

Connected by underlying emissions - pulses that are connected where the emission doesn't go below 0 
(if hits zero, don't apply it)

Simple pulse - 1 pulse only 

Symmetrical - can be 1 bin. 

Rapid - In one pulse blue region where there should be one pulse there actually is multiple pulses. Also for the record, this has to happen in a time scale of less than 5 seconds. 

Variations in the pulse that are the same size vertically as the noise would be considered noise fluctuations In the pulse 

Even if likely that it looks like something, write down I don't see any of these and then in field notes, write what it kinda looks like 

If there is a gap in the data, its because there is an observation constraint so the instrument had to turn away resulting In this gap
200205B - Data gap in the burst, triggered the data twice which caused a problem trying to save the data resulting In what you see right now.
